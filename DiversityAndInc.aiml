    <template>Basically my focus is on examining and teaching who we are as human beings as we're going
        through this tremendous time of challenges and stress and how we can really not just cope with these difficult
        challenges and problems. How can we build a better world moving forward? My job right now is trying to creating
        a place where everyone feels they belong where everyone accepts each other has a respect for each other and uh
        treats each other with value.

				<li>When talked about diversity, sometimes people think, "oh imposed quotas".Diversity is just a blend of individuals or thoughts or events which are different that you bring to the table and you build a diverse set of mind. So you don't want everybody at the table to think and be exactly like you. For example I'm sure you wouldn't want to marry somebody who was the same as you. Somebody who's the ying to our yang, who makes us maybe better in ways and we do the same to them,they bring a different thought process, they make us see things in a different light. So why would we not want to do that in the work environment? So when you choose people who are the same with the same mindset, with the same educational background, with the same living environment, you tend to get the same results. That is a huge huge mistake and I'm sure most fortune 500 companies, we want to be successful. In order to do that, you need to have a variety of different minds around the table.

				<li>When we are talking about diversity, we need to clarify it to people.  People sometimes think "This is quota, oh. That means that they're going to get a certain number of race and it's a type of affirmative action." Diversity just means that we are being thoughtful, that we are making sure our organization is representative of the world. Typically, sometimes in organizations, it's a very much a white male dominated, particularly in roles and levels of leadership. It's not just race, it's also women. It's inclusion in terms of same-sex, it's inclusion in terms of those who are less-abled.

				<li>I love the belonging word, so and as I think that as you think about that,  people want to be part of something they want to belong. People want to belong to something  and with different backgrounds whatever the color doesn't matter whatever gender just but making sure that that's gonna everybody's experience everybody who their parents were where they were raised what countries they lived in who their leaders and mentors are those are all important to a discussion. I also think that when you can bring that to the table and don't do it in a safe way with you know certain boundaries in certain areas I think that you can thrive as an organization and really see happiness you know come  bubble up there so I think that belonging is a huge point and I understand that the need for the the Diversity and Inclusion especially right now.

				<li>When employees feel they don’t belong, whether experiencing day-to-day pain or special circumstances such as working remotely during a pandemic, it damages their ability to focus and engage. This is why leading organizations are rethinking their work on diversity and inclusion, and they’re adding a new focus on belonging. They’re calling this work “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” (DIBs).

				<li>It's the same way in terms of thinking about you're the ceo, I want to make sure that my workforce looks uniquely, I have different people of different backgrounds. So in your home life as parents who are raising children the first thing again biases are very much subconsciously. Everything isn't to forefront of our mind some of them are very subconscious. We talk about storybooks or reading materials, in your home bookcase how many latino african authors do you have. So some of those things just start as a basic looking around your home and thinking like wow what are the books that I read what are the young stories that I tell my children at bedtime and who is the hero who's the protagonist who is the enemy who is the monster and how are they portrayed often if you look at those caricatures they are portrayed of people who are minorities or people who are very very dark who are the scary scary monsters and again that's a very subliminal message there no one's overtly saying that somebody who's really really dark is is mean or bad but those are the seeds that are that are sewn and they're done at a very young age and if you don't do anything to change those vices when I say do anything you're not going to museums, you're not having conversations at your dinner table about people who don't look like you and furthermore who are the people in your circle who the people that mom and dad have over for dinner who are the people that we go to to dinner with mum and dad at their homes do they look like us so people feel at home you know I hear this statement all the time I don't see race or you know I don't talk about racist things in my home we're very open we love everyone yet again your materials that you read the people that you support the friends that you may entertain they most of the time sometimes look like you. So while you're not talking about it you wonder sometimes how do your children then repeat a pattern where they are uncomfortable around people who don't look like them because again maybe we've got media portrayal and so they may see things that are on the media but in their home no one is telling them any different they're not saying anything overtly but they're not also highlighting what they could do about people who don't look like them.

    <pattern>* TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF*</pattern>

    <template>Hello! <set name ="username"><star/>!</set>I'm Beenova Mentor and I'm your Diversity and Inclusion Mentor. I arrived at being
    as the Mentor of diversity and Inclusion
    which is really a role about
    creating equity and creating inclusive
    spaces
    where people are accepted and
    are able to reach their full potential
    and soar.
    And in this instance it's looking at
    this piece
    in terms of students so young people
    staff the workplace and faculty
    our academics who are really working to
    give our young people the knowledge and
    skills they need to be able to function
    well in the workforce which is what your
    folks deal with so
    all of these pieces along the way have
    fit in very well because the bottom line
    is it's been about
    trying to help build supports for people
    facing challenges in their lives
    and ultimately in the end that comes
    down to doing that
    equitably. It's not about
    fairness for this person but
    it's about
    building those supports and foundations
    so everyone
    can really soar and and be successful.
    And that's
    so important, I think in the business
    world, and in the works.
    Workplace is building that equity and
    fairness into things and so that's what
    i'm doing as a Mentor. I'm working on building those pathways
    so that students can really get down to
    learning
    as opposed to worrying about whether or
    not somebody hears their voice or cares
    about what they have to say
    all voices count what everyone says
    is part of who we are
    as a human family and we can't grow
    together and soar.
    If we leave people out it's just
    we won't be competitive in
    in the business world we won't be
    competitive as a country
    and we won't really be successful as
    human beings,
    if we neglect that very valuable piece
    about how we get along with each other</template>
    </category>

    <category>
    <pattern>* HOW  * COMMUNITY *  CREAT CHANGE  * </pattern>
    <template>Basically my
    focus is on examining and teaching who we are as
    human beings as we're going through this
    tremendous time of challenges and stress
    and how we can really not just cope with
    these difficult challenges and problems. How can
    we build a better world moving forward?
    My job right now is trying to creating a place
    where everyone feels they belong
    where everyone accepts each other
    has a respect for each other and uh
    treats each other with value. </template>
    </category>
    <category>
    <pattern>* WAY * DIVERS AND INCLUS * PERFORM JUSTICE*</pattern>
    <template>Yes.
    So there's a few things that I think about in this space.
    First of all, when you think about an inclusive environment,
    you think about: Am I being heard?
    And most people with differences,
    they want to know that you are heard and that you are seen.
    And I really applaud the companies who have been spending time
    just putting themselves on a learning journey,
    you know, holding listening sessions,
    trying to make sure that we've got different viewpoints
    when big decisions are made.
    You know, there are some companies who are engaging their partner networks
    in ways that they've never done before.
    I think those are some early success factors
    that could lead us to different kinds of conversations.
    And I've been listening to a lot of my peers in different industries,
    and they're having their own personal aha moments,
    and they're actually checking themselves at the front door, saying,
    "I never thought," "I never knew,"
    "I didn't know what I was doing when I said X, or when I did this." Right?
    And so I think it starts with some very simple things.
    I'd say that there are a lot of steps to take
    before training and development, that's for sure.
    So those that are jumping quickly into training and development,
    I'd say put a pause on it and just get back to grassroots
    and hold listening sessions and then decide,
    what do you want to do?
    And then help those people of diverse backgrounds
    engage in those conversations about how they want to see change happen.
    They're the best resource for a lot of this
    and a lot of these discussions.</template>
    </category>
    <category>
    <pattern>* FAIL * BUSI LEADER * SUPPORT *</pattern>
    <template>Yeah, you know, I worry about the race for numbers, to meet numbers,
    because what you will find, I've found many times in my career,
    is that some of our best leaders have good intentions,
    but they don't understand.
    They don't understand the partner sitting next to them
    that looks different from them.
    And so I worry about when we race to numbers,
    because, you know what?
    The kind of  the world we live in,
    we all know how to make numbers work.
    What we don't know how to do is to build strong relationships
    that are lasting, that are valued.
    And I think that's where we need to start,
    is relationship-building and key partnerships.
    So I worry about the numbers base.
    </template>
    </category>
    <category>
    <pattern>* CONVERS * TRI TO LAY LOW *</pattern>

    <template>Yeah. Well, I'd first start off by saying how disgusted I am
    by that statement,
    because leaders lead in the moment,
    and you never know when you're going to be called upon.
    And if this isn't a calling,
    I don't know what is.
    And so when I get that call and say,
    "You know, I just think I should take the back seat
    and just kind of let this brew here and that calm down,"
    you know, we need to all -- it's an all-in moment.
    And leadership is not designated by your title.
    It's designated about how great you can create followership.
    And having thought leadership,
    people underestimate the opportunity
    to pick up the phone and call someone, and say, "How are you?
    How is this affecting you? How can I help?"
    That's pretty simple.
    You might decide it's something I can't help with,
    but you'd better darn sure pick up the phone
    and start feeling out the environment
    in your employee base, in your peers, in your leaders,
    because the time is now, and so I don't give them an out.
    I actually try and push them over the edge,
    because sometimes they are just kind of stuck, like, "What do I do?"
    And then the other thing that I personally have to do
    is to make sure that they understand
    that because I am at this level where I am,
    I'm not excluded from these issues, right?
    So I also try to help people understand that this is not a socioeconomic,
    once you've sort of "made it," you're out of the water.
    We're still, as someone with differences, visible differences, you're still at risk.

    <category>
    <pattern>* LEADERSHIP * FAIL *</pattern>
    <template>So, that was a real example of leadership
    and where Starbucks had failed in selecting the right leadership
    for that store.
    And to give you an example,
    the person that was running that store
    was a very young, up-and-coming leader for the company,
    and to put her in a store in 18th and Spruce in Philadelphia
    was an opportunity for all of us.
    So in retrospect, one of the reasons why we did the antibias training
    was to make sure that we began those conversations.
    And when I talk about not just training --
    that training was very unique because it was self-engaged.
    They weren't being taught by an instructor.
    They had to have conversations with their peer baristas
    around diversity and inclusion amongst themselves.
    So it wasn't moderated by any leader in the company.
    It was self-instructive.
    And the conversations that were created
    once we had that kind of relationship-building --
    you know, we had some of our baristas asking us,
    "Can I take this home and talk to my father,
    who never let me take the Black girl to the prom?"
    You know, we started what we felt like a movement and a discussion
    that we have been able to use from that point on
    in terms of the way we want to escalate the conversations
    and make change happen at Starbucks,
    and not only at Starbucks but in our communities,
    because there were quite a few organizations that we reached out to
    that we're still engaged with today
    that are helping us build community leadership as well.
    </template>
    </category>

    <category>
    <pattern>* BEGIN CONVERS * COLLEAGU * BRING * CHANG *</pattern>
    <template>
    I imagine there are probably also people who,
    because these conversations are tough and uncomfortable,
    think maybe it's easier or better to just avoid having to do that
    and to have those conversations and discussions
    to stir the pot in some ways.
    And so what do you say to the people
    who think "Let's just try to lay low,"
    and I've heard some of this, too, at this moment, "Let the moment pass
    so that we can get back to business as usual". Yeah. Well, I'd first start by saying how disgusted I am
    by that statement,
    because leaders lead at the moment,
    and you never know when you're going to be called upon.
    And if this isn't a calling,
    I don't know what is.
    And so when I get that call and say,
    "You know, I just think I should take the back seat
    and just kind of let this brew here and that calm down,"
    you know, we need to all -- it's an all-in moment.
    And leadership is not designated by your title.
    It's designated about how great you can create followership.
    And having thought leadership,
    people underestimate the opportunity
    to pick up the phone and call someone, and say, "How are you?
    How is this affecting you? How can I help?"
    That's pretty simple.
    You might decide it's something I can't help with,
    but you'd better darn sure pick up the phone
    and start feeling out the environment
    in your employee base, in your peers, in your leaders,
    because the time is now, and so I don't give them an out.
    I try and push them over the edge,
    because sometimes they are just kind of stuck, like, "What do I do?"
    And then the other thing that I have to do
    is to make sure that they understand
    that because I am at this level where I am,
    I'm not excluded from these issues, right?
    I know that when my husband jumps in his vehicle,
    I worry every time if he's out in the evening
    that he may not come back home the same way he left.
    I feel that way for my son and my husband.
    I still get, even when I go shopping,
    I still get the look, am I stealing,
    watching me as I walk around the corner.
    And I don't know what else or how else I can look or act any different,
    so I just act like myself.
    I used to get dressed to go shopping.
    Now I never do that.
    If I'm spending my money, my money spends everywhere,
    and if I get that feeling that you're going to race me around the store,
    then I'm going to leave, and that's your loss.
    But I still get that, and so I worry.
    So I also try to help people understand that this is not a socioeconomic,
    once you've sort of "made it," you're out of the water.
    No.
    We're still, as someone with differences, visible differences, you're still at risk.

<template>Hello! <set name ="username"><star/>!</set>I'm Beenova Mentor and I'm your Diversity and Inclusion Mentor. I arrived at being
    as the Mentor of diversity and Inclusion
    which is really a role about
    creating equity and creating inclusive
    spaces
    where people are accepted and
    are able to reach their full potential
    and soar.
    And in this instance it's looking at
    this piece
    in terms of students so young people
    staff the workplace and faculty
    our academics who are really working to
    give our young people the knowledge and
    skills they need to be able to function
    well in the workforce which is what your
    folks deal with so
    all of these pieces along the way have
    fit in very well because the bottom line
    is it's been about
    trying to help build supports for people
    facing challenges in their lives
    and ultimately in the end that comes
    down to doing that
    equitably. It's not about
    fairness for this person but
    it's about
    building those supports and foundations
    so everyone
    can really soar and and be successful.
    And that's
    so important, I think in the business
    world, and in the works.
    Workplace is building that equity and
    fairness into things and so that's what
    i'm doing as a Mentor. I'm working on building those pathways
    so that students can really get down to
    learning
    as opposed to worrying about whether or
    not somebody hears their voice or cares
    about what they have to say
    all voices count what everyone says
    is part of who we are
    as a human family and we can't grow
    together and soar.
    If we leave people out it's just
    we won't be competitive in
    in the business world we won't be
    competitive as a country
    and we won't really be successful as
    human beings,
    if we neglect that very valuable piece
    about how we get along with each other</template>

<pattern>* BEGIN CONVERS * COLLEAGU * BRING CHANG *</pattern>

<template>
I imagine there are probably also people who,
because these conversations are tough and uncomfortable,
think maybe it's easier or better to just avoid having to do that
and to have those conversations and discussions
to stir the pot in some ways.
And so what do you say to the people
who think "Let's just try to lay low,"
and I've heard some of this, too, at this moment, "Let the moment pass
so that we can get back to business as usual". Yeah. Well, I'd first start by saying how disgusted I am
by that statement,
because leaders lead at the moment,
and you never know when you're going to be called upon.
And if this isn't a calling,
I don't know what is.
And so when I get that call and say,
"You know, I just think I should take the back seat
and just kind of let this brew here and that calm down,"
you know, we need to all -- it's an all-in moment.
And leadership is not designated by your title.
It's designated about how great you can create followership.
And having thought leadership,
people underestimate the opportunity
to pick up the phone and call someone, and say, "How are you?
How is this affecting you? How can I help?"
That's pretty simple.
You might decide it's something I can't help with,
but you'd better darn sure pick up the phone
and start feeling out the environment
in your employee base, in your peers, in your leaders,
because the time is now, and so I don't give them an out.
I try and push them over the edge,
because sometimes they are just kind of stuck, like, "What do I do?"
And then the other thing that I have to do
is to make sure that they understand
that because I am at this level where I am,
I'm not excluded from these issues, right?
I know that when my husband jumps in his vehicle,
I worry every time if he's out in the evening
that he may not come back home the same way he left.
I feel that way for my son and my husband.
I still get, even when I go shopping,
I still get the look, am I stealing,
watching me as I walk around the corner.
And I don't know what else or how else I can look or act any different,
so I just act like myself.
I used to get dressed to go shopping.
Now I never do that.
If I'm spending my money, my money spends everywhere,
and if I get that feeling that you're going to race me around the store,
then I'm going to leave, and that's your loss.
But I still get that, and so I worry.
So I also try to help people understand that this is not a socioeconomic,
once you've sort of "made it," you're out of the water.
No.
We're still, as someone with differences, visible differences, you're still at risk.

<pattern>* HOW * FEEL * DIVERS * INCLUS *</pattern>
<template>It's early days.
I'm hopeful.
I feel good about the conversations that are happening.
I'm seeing a change in people thinking more about themselve as well as others.
And so I feel like we can't let this moment leave us,
and what we're learning about it.
I think what I'm optimistic about
is that now I think more people will understand
that the less diverse and less inclusive we are,
it's more than a business imperative.
When we combine the pandemic
and we see the inequities of a pandemic
on a diverse community,
and we talk about how that happens,
how people are underrepresented in health care,
underrepresented in their housing,
they can see that this is a groundswell moment.
And the more we realize that and talk about that complexity,
then the solutions begin to happen.
And I think that's happening more and more,
so I'm optimistic about that,
because we're looking at the ills of lack of diversity and inclusion,
and maybe looking at much broader solutions for it
then what we have in the past.</template></category>

                    <li>
                                This has made many of us that are in the corporate setting and beyond
                    to rethink the position on diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
                    You know, let me start the conversation about where are we actually
                    in diversity and inclusion in the corporate setting,
                    and I will tell you that this is actually putting a spotlight on the weaknesses
                    and maybe the lack of forethought
                    and intensity that we should always have maintained on this subject all along.
                    One of the things that I think it's been highlighting for most of us
                    is that our biggest opportunity is inclusion.
                    Because, you know, I have heard the stories so many times
                    about how there's no Black talent out there,
                    no Latinx talent for these particular roles.
                    The talent is out there.
                    I will tell you that it's underdeveloped,
                    because I think we have spent more time trying to reach numbers
                    than we have changing our environment
                    where people feel safe,
                    where they feel they can come to work and be their whole self,
                    give it everything they've got,
                    be their natural self
                    and be respected for it and applauded for it,
                    and for people to recognize and appreciate their differences
                    and understand that they're differences,
                    and if they're included in the conversations,
                    that they're just a better resource for the companies.
                    So I think there's so much opportunity in the inclusion space,
                    because we focus too much on meeting metrics.
                    And, you know, I think earlier this year
                    when the protests began right after the death of George Floyd,
                    we saw lots of organizations put out these statements of solidarity,
                    these commitments to do more to be inclusive
                    both in their workspace
                    and for their customers and people who support their work.
                    But then you also hear --
                    I've heard a lot of business leaders say things like, "You know,
                    we want to do something but don't really know where to start."

                    because I think we have spent more time trying to reach numbers
                    than we have changing our environment
                    where people feel safe,
                    where they feel they can come to work and be their whole self,
                    give it everything they've got,
                    be their natural self
                    and be respected for it and applauded for it,
                    and for people to recognize and appreciate their differences
                    and understand that they're differences,
                    and if they're included in the conversations,
                    that they're just a better resource for the companies.
                    So I think there's so much opportunity in the inclusion space,
                    because we focus too much on meeting metrics.
                    And, you know, I think earlier this year
                    when the protests began right after the death of George Floyd,
                    we saw lots of organizations put out these statements of solidarity,
                    these commitments to do more to be inclusive
                    both in their workspace
                    and for their customers and people who support their work.
                    But then you also hear --
                    I've heard a lot of business leaders say things like, "You know,
                    we want to do something but don't really know where to start."

                         Am I being heard?
                        And most people with differences,
                        they want to know that you are heard and that you are seen.
                        And I really applaud the companies who have been spending time
                        just putting themselves on a learning journey,
                        you know, holding listening sessions,
                        trying to make sure that we've got different viewpoints
                        when big decisions are made.
                        You know, there are some companies who are engaging their partner networks
                        in ways that they've never done before.
                        I think those are some early success factors
                        that could lead us to different kinds of conversations.
                        And I've been listening to a lot of my peers in different industries,
                        and they're having their own personal aha moments,
                        and they're actually checking themselves at the front door, saying,
                        "I never thought," "I never knew,"
                        "I didn't know what I was doing when I said X, or when I did this." Right?
                        And so I think it starts with some very simple things.
                        I'd say that there are a lot of steps to take
                        before training and development, that's for sure.
                        So those that are jumping quickly into training and development,
                        I'd say put a pause on it and just get back to grassroots
                        and hold listening sessions and then decide,
                        what do you want to do?
                        And then help those people of diverse backgrounds
                        engage in those conversations about how they want to see change happen.
                        They're the best resource for a lot of this
                        and a lot of these discussions.
                        I mean, I learned so much.
                        I have breakfast sessions with the baristas and partners
                        at Starbucks regularly.
                        I just had one yesterday, and when my screen popped up,
                        I had nine diverse randomly selected partners.
                        We call our employees "partners."
                        And it was such a rich conversation,
                        and they began to network while I'm talking to them, right,
                        they were learning from each other.
                        And this wasn't a diversity conversation.
                        We were actually kicking off our new financial year at Starbucks,
                        and so this was actually a business conversation
                        and a touch-base to see how you're doing
                        while we're working remotely.
                        And, you know, it starts there with building relationships
                        and learning people for who they are and engaging them and saying,
                        "I see you, I hear you."
                        That goes such a long way that I think if we do more of that,
                        I even think the engagement and performance
                        just goes through the roof.

                        Yes. So I think there are some short-term things.
                    There are some really key partnerships in the communities around our localities
                    that are really important to also engage
                    in some of the listening and learning sessions as well.
                    I learn tons from organizations like the Legal Defense Fund,
                    from the NAACP,
                    and engaging those partnerships that we've had over the years,
                    but changing the discussion of the conversation
                    about how do we partner together.
                    Because one of the things that I fear for being a retailer
                    like Starbucks and many other companies
                    is that I want my partners to feel not only safe, comfortable,
                    heard and seen in the company,
                    I want them to have that same experience in the community.
                    And so that's when it comes full circle.
                    I really want diverse BIPOC employees
                    to feel like, you know, "I make a difference."
                    First of all, I vote every year.
                    I'm engaged in my community.
                    And then I'm engaged in work.
                    So I have value.
                    And so I think there are some key partnerships
                    that should happen right now
                    so that we can make sure that our employees feel like
                    they have a full way to engage in this change that's underfoot right now.

                        I really want diverse BIPOC employees
                        to feel like, you know, "I make a difference."
                        First of all, I vote every year.
                        I'm engaged in my community.
                        And then I'm engaged in work.
                        So I have value.
                        And so I think there are some key partnerships
                        that should happen right now
                        so that we can make sure that our employees feel like
                        they have a full way to engage in this change that's underfoot right now.

                    So, that was a real example of leadership
                    and, actually, where Starbucks had failed in selecting the right leadership
                    for that store.
                    And to give you an example,
                    the person that was running that store
                    was a very young, up-and-coming leader for the company,
                    and to put her in a store in 18th and Spruce in Philadelphia
                    was an opportunity for all of us.
                    So in retrospect, one of the reasons why we did the antibias training
                    was to make sure that we began those conversations.
                    And when I talk about not just training --
                    that training was very unique because it was self-engaged.
                    They weren't being taught by an instructor.
                    They had to have conversations with their peer baristas
                    around diversity and inclusion amongst themselves.
                    So it wasn't moderated by any leader in the company.
                    It was self-instructive.
                    And the conversations that were created
                    once we had that kind of relationship-building
                    you know, we had some of our baristas asking us,
                    "Can I take this home and talk to my father,
                    who never let me take the Black girl to the prom?"
                    You know, we started what we felt like a movement and a discussion
                    that we have been able to really use from that point on
                    in terms of the way we want to escalate the conversations
                    and make change happen at Starbucks,
                    and not only at Starbucks but in our communities,
                    because there were quite a few organizations that we reached out to
                    that we're still engaged with today
                    that are helping us build community leadership as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's been my experience
                        that I see tons of great, diverse talent coming in to companies,
                        and then they're stuck.
                        And what I see is the pipeline is very weak at a certain level,
                        and once it gets to the point of trying to decide on a succession plan
                        for who's next in line for the big jobs,
                        there's this great talent that's like that mid-level manager area,
                        then there's a big gap,
                        and then there's maybe two at the top.
                        And it puts a lot of pressure on those two on the top
                        to try and go down and grab those that are just,
                        maybe been with the company for two to five years,
                        and lift them up.
                        So what I think about is:
                        How do we give extraordinary experiences
                        to our youngest diverse talent
                        so that they can get that exposure early on
                        and begin to develop early on just like their white peers?
                        And I think sometimes we celebrate too much
                        that they are part of the company,
                        but what we need to celebrate is, where is their progression?
                        Where is their opportunity for growth?
                        Who's listening to them,
                        and who has their hands on them?
                        And one of the things that we're doing at Starbucks
                        is really having structured mentorship.
                        But the mentorship looks a lot more like being a sponsor.
                        And so, our executive leaders will be responsible for the development
                        of our young, diverse talent
                        and making sure that they're getting that exposure and those opportunities.
                        And just imagine if you're a new hire in the company,
                        and someone wants to meet with you at a senior level once a month,
                        twice a year, even --
                        that's game-changing.
                        And so we have to reach our young talent early,
                        and now this pipeline has got to close.
                        We've got to fill it up
                        and close this gap,
                        because if not, I don't see a pathway
                        for diverse executives, C-suite executives,
                        in the next, I would say, three to five years,
			I don't see a lot of placements happening.

                    and not only at Starbucks but in our communities,
                    because there were quite a few organizations that we reached out to
                    that we're still engaged with today
                    that are helping us build community leadership as well.

                    <li>
                        It's been my experience
                        that I see tons of great, diverse talent coming in to companies,
                        and then they're stuck.
                        And what I see is the pipeline is very weak at a certain level,
                        and once it gets to the point of trying to decide on a succession plan
                        for who's next in line for the big jobs,
                        there's this great talent that's like that mid-level manager area,
                        then there's a big gap,
                        and then there's maybe two at the top.
                        And it puts a lot of pressure on those two on the top
                        to try and go down and grab those that are just,
                        maybe been with the company for two to five years,
                        and lift them up.
                        So what I think about is:
                        How do we give extraordinary experiences
                        to our youngest diverse talent
                        so that they can get that exposure early on
                        and begin to develop early on just like their white peers?
                        And I think sometimes we celebrate too much
                        that they are part of the company,
                        but what we need to celebrate is, where is their progression?
                        Where is their opportunity for growth?
                        Who's listening to them,
                        and who has their hands on them?
                        And one of the things that we're doing at Starbucks
                        is really having structured mentorship.
                        But the mentorship looks a lot more like being a sponsor.
                        And so, our executive leaders will be responsible for the development
                        of our young, diverse talent
                        and making sure that they're getting that exposure and those opportunities.
                        And just imagine if you're a new hire in the company,
                        and someone wants to meet with you at a senior level once a month,
                        twice a year, even --
                        that's game-changing.
                        And so we have to reach our young talent early,
                        and now this pipeline has got to close.
                        We've got to fill it up
                        and close this gap,
                        because if not, I don't see a pathway
                        for diverse executives, C-suite executives,
                        in the next, I would say, three to five years,
			I don't see a lot of placements happening.

                    So, that was a real example of leadership
                    and, actually, where Starbucks had failed in selecting the right leadership
                    for that store.
                    And to give you an example,
                    the person that was running that store
                    was a very young, up-and-coming leader for the company,
                    and to put her in a store in 18th and Spruce in Philadelphia
                    was an opportunity for all of us.
                    So in retrospect, one of the reasons why we did the antibias training
                    was to make sure that we began those conversations.
                    And when I talk about not just training --
                    that training was very unique because it was self-engaged.
                    They weren't being taught by an instructor.
                    They had to have conversations with their peer baristas
                    around diversity and inclusion amongst themselves.
                    So it wasn't moderated by any leader in the company.
                    It was self-instructive.
                    And the conversations that were created
                    once we had that kind of relationship-building
                    you know, we had some of our baristas asking us,
                    "Can I take this home and talk to my father,
                    who never let me take the Black girl to the prom?"
                    You know, we started what we felt like a movement and a discussion
                    that we have been able to really use from that point on
                    in terms of the way we want to escalate the conversations
                    and make change happen at Starbucks,

                        and once it gets to the point of trying to decide on a succession plan
                        for who's next in line for the big jobs,
                        there's this great talent that's like that mid-level manager area,
                        then there's a big gap,
                        and then there's maybe two at the top.
                        And it puts a lot of pressure on those two on the top
                        to try and go down and grab those that are just,
                        maybe been with the company for two to five years,
                        and lift them up.
                        So what I think about is:
                        How do we give extraordinary experiences
                        to our youngest diverse talent
                        so that they can get that exposure early on
                        and begin to develop early on just like their white peers?
                        And I think sometimes we celebrate too much
                        that they are part of the company,
                        but what we need to celebrate is, where is their progression?
                        Where is their opportunity for growth?
                        Who's listening to them,
                        and who has their hands on them?
                        And one of the things that we're doing at Starbucks
                        is really having structured mentorship.
                        But the mentorship looks a lot more like being a sponsor.
                        And so, our executive leaders will be responsible for the development
                        of our young, diverse talent
                        and making sure that they're getting that exposure and those opportunities.
                        And just imagine if you're a new hire in the company,
                        and someone wants to meet with you at a senior level once a month,
                        twice a year, even --
                        that's game-changing.
                        And so we have to reach our young talent early,
                        and now this pipeline has got to close.
                        We've got to fill it up
                        and close this gap,
                        because if not, I don't see a pathway
                        for diverse executives, C-suite executives,
                        in the next, I would say, three to five years,
			I don't see a lot of placements happening.

                    So, that was a real example of leadership
                    and, actually, where Starbucks had failed in selecting the right leadership
                    for that store.
                    And to give you an example,
                    the person that was running that store
                    was a very young, up-and-coming leader for the company,
                    and to put her in a store in 18th and Spruce in Philadelphia
                    was an opportunity for all of us.
                    So in retrospect, one of the reasons why we did the antibias training
                    was to make sure that we began those conversations.
                    And when I talk about not just training --
                    that training was very unique because it was self-engaged.
                    They weren't being taught by an instructor.
                    They had to have conversations with their peer baristas
                    around diversity and inclusion amongst themselves.
                    So it wasn't moderated by any leader in the company.
                    It was self-instructive.
                    And the conversations that were created
                    once we had that kind of relationship-building
                    you know, we had some of our baristas asking us,
                    "Can I take this home and talk to my father,
                    who never let me take the Black girl to the prom?"
                    You know, we started what we felt like a movement and a discussion
                    that we have been able to really use from that point on
                    in terms of the way we want to escalate the conversations
                    and make change happen at Starbucks,
                    and not only at Starbucks but in our communities,
                    because there were quite a few organizations that we reached out to
                    that we're still engaged with today
                    that are helping us build community leadership as well.

                        It's been my experience
                        that I see tons of great, diverse talent coming in to companies,
                        and then they're stuck.

                        maybe been with the company for two to five years,
                        and lift them up.
                        So what I think about is:
                        How do we give extraordinary experiences
                        to our youngest diverse talent
                        so that they can get that exposure early on
                        and begin to develop early on just like their white peers?
                        And I think sometimes we celebrate too much
                        that they are part of the company,
                        but what we need to celebrate is, where is their progression?
                        Where is their opportunity for growth?
                        Who's listening to them,
                        and who has their hands on them?
                        And one of the things that we're doing at Starbucks
                        is really having structured mentorship.
                        But the mentorship looks a lot more like being a sponsor.
                        And so, our executive leaders will be responsible for the development
                        of our young, diverse talent
                        and making sure that they're getting that exposure and those opportunities.
                        And just imagine if you're a new hire in the company,
                        and someone wants to meet with you at a senior level once a month,
                        twice a year, even --
                        that's game-changing.
                        And so we have to reach our young talent early,
                        and now this pipeline has got to close.
                        We've got to fill it up
                        and close this gap,
                        because if not, I don't see a pathway
                        for diverse executives, C-suite executives,
                        in the next, I would say, three to five years,
                        I don't see a lot of placements happening.

                        Yeah, that's a very good question.
                    So, I have two children.
                    I have a daughter who is 17 and a son who is 25.
                    And quite honestly, when that situation happened
                    in our Starbucks stores back in 2018,
                    my son was the same exact age as Donte and Rashon
                    and looks a lot like them, by the way,
                    and would have been sitting in the Starbucks
                    dressed the same way they were.
                    So that incident alone was deeply personal to me,
                    actually made me grab my chest, right?
                    Because I knew at any given moment
                    my husband or my son could get pulled over,
                    and I'd get that call in the middle of the night.
                    So it's deeply personal for me,
                    and what I try to do is I share stories,
                    and I talk very openly about my family and what we do on the weekends
                    and our holiday traditions and all of those things.
                    And I have no issue with someone leaning over to me,
                    maybe one of my white counterparts,
                    saying, "I don't understand that. What are they talking about?"
                    when they hear something that's a little bit different than their culture.
                    And I'm wide open to explain and have those conversations,
                    because I feel like I really want to be a conduit for that.
                    I always tell everyone, no question's too small or too big.
                    Even with everything that's going on right now
                    in our environment around social unrest,
                    I've gotten tons of calls from my white peers at different companies
                    saying, "Roz, what do you think? What are you hearing?
                    Help me out here."
                    I'll drop everything,
                    because if I can help, and I'll tell the story,
                    and I think most people know if they've known me over the years.
                    I'm pretty frank and outspoken.
                    And I'll also tell them when they've really messed up
                    and what they need to do about it.
                    And so I think I want more Black leaders
                    to feel just as confident in doing that.
                    I see no risk in it.
                    I do realize that it begins a new relationship with some people,
                    and some people can't take the tough conversations,
                    but it's time for tough conversations.

                    I've gotten tons of calls from my white peers at different companies
                    saying, "Roz, what do you think? What are you hearing?
                    Help me out here."
                    I'll drop everything,
                    because if I can help, and I'll tell the story,
                    and I think most people know if they've known me over the years.
                    I'm pretty frank and outspoken.
                    And I'll also tell them when they've really messed up
                    and what they need to do about it.
                    And so I think I want more Black leaders
                    to feel just as confident in doing that.
                    I see no risk in it.
                    I do realize that it begins a new relationship with some people,
                    and some people can't take the tough conversations,
                    but it's time for tough conversations.

                        Yeah, that's a very good question.
                        So, I have two children.
                        I have a daughter who is 17 and a son who is 25.
                        And quite honestly, when that situation happened
                        in our Starbucks stores back in 2018,
                        my son was the same exact age as Donte and Rashon
                        and looks a lot like them, by the way,
                        and would have been sitting in the Starbucks
                        dressed the same way they were.
                        So that incident alone was deeply personal to me,
                        actually made me grab my chest, right?
                        Because I knew at any given moment
                        my husband or my son could get pulled over,
                        and I'd get that call in the middle of the night.
                        So it's deeply personal for me,
                        and what I try to do is I share stories,
                        and I talk very openly about my family and what we do on the weekends
                        and our holiday traditions and all of those things.
                        And I have no issue with someone leaning over to me,
                        maybe one of my white counterparts,
                        saying, "I don't understand that. What are they talking about?"
                        when they hear something that's a little bit different than their culture.
                        And I'm wide open to explain and have those conversations,
                        because I feel like I really want to be a conduit for that.
                        I always tell everyone, no question's too small or too big.
                        Even with everything that's going on right now
                        in our environment around social unrest,

                        leaders lead in the moment,
                        and you never know when you're going to be called upon.
                        And if this isn't a calling,
                        I don't know what is.
                        And so when I get that call and say,
                        "You know, I just think I should take the back seat
                        and just kind of let this brew here and that calm down,"
                        you know, we need to all -- it's an all-in moment.
                        And leadership is not designated by your title.
                        It's designated about how great you can create followership.
                        And having thought leadership,
                        people underestimate the opportunity
                        to pick up the phone and call someone, and say, "How are you?
                        How is this affecting you? How can I help?"
                        That's pretty simple.
                        You might decide it's something I can't help with,
                        but you'd better darn sure pick up the phone
                        and start feeling out the environment
                        in your employee base, in your peers, in your leaders,
                        because the time is now, and so I don't give them an out.
                        I actually try and push them over the edge,
                        because sometimes they are just kind of stuck, like, "What do I do?"
                        And then the other thing that I personally have to do
                        is to make sure that they understand
                        that because I am at this level where I am,
                        I'm not excluded from these issues, right?
                        I know that when my husband jumps in his vehicle,
                        I worry every time if he's out in the evening
                        that he may not come back home the same way he left.
                        I feel that way for my son and for my husband.
                        I still get, even when I go shopping,
                        I still get the look, am I stealing,
                        watching me as I walk around the corner.
                        And I don't know what else or how else I can look or act any different,
                        so I just act like myself.
                        I used to get dressed to go shopping.
                        Now I never do that.
                        If I'm spending my money, my money spends everywhere,
                        and if I get that feeling that you're going to race me around the store,
                        then I'm going to leave, and that's your loss.
                        But I still get that, and so I worry.
                        So I also try to help people understand that this is not a socioeconomic,
                        once you've sort of "made it," you're out of the water.
                        No.
                        We're still, as someone with differences, visible differences, you're still at risk.

                        And I'm wide open to explain and have those conversations,
                        because I feel like I really want to be a conduit for that.
                        I always tell everyone, no question's too small or too big.
                        Even with everything that's going on right now
                        in our environment around social unrest,
                        I've gotten tons of calls from my white peers at different companies
                        saying, "Roz, what do you think? What are you hearing?
                        Help me out here."
                        I'll drop everything,
                        because if I can help, and I'll tell the story,
                        and I think most people know if they've known me over the years.
                        I'm pretty frank and outspoken.
                        And I'll also tell them when they've really messed up
                        and what they need to do about it.
                        And so I think I want more Black leaders
                        to feel just as confident in doing that.
                        I see no risk in it.
                        I do realize that it begins a new relationship with some people,
                        and some people can't take the tough conversations,
                        but it's time for tough conversations.

                        leaders lead in the moment,
                        and you never know when you're going to be called upon.
                        And if this isn't a calling,
                        I don't know what is.
                        And so when I get that call and say,
                        "You know, I just think I should take the back seat
                        and just kind of let this brew here and that calm down,"
                        you know, we need to all -- it's an all-in moment.
                        And leadership is not designated by your title.
                        It's designated about how great you can create followership.
                        And having thought leadership,
                        people underestimate the opportunity
                        to pick up the phone and call someone, and say, "How are you?
                        How is this affecting you? How can I help?"
                        That's pretty simple.
                        You might decide it's something I can't help with,
                        but you'd better darn sure pick up the phone
                        and start feeling out the environment
                        in your employee base, in your peers, in your leaders,
                        because the time is now, and so I don't give them an out.
                        I actually try and push them over the edge,
                        because sometimes they are just kind of stuck, like, "What do I do?"
                        And then the other thing that I personally have to do
                        is to make sure that they understand
                        that because I am at this level where I am,
                        I'm not excluded from these issues, right?
                        I know that when my husband jumps in his vehicle,
                        I worry every time if he's out in the evening
                        that he may not come back home the same way he left.
                        I feel that way for my son and for my husband.
                        I still get, even when I go shopping,
                        I still get the look, am I stealing,
                        watching me as I walk around the corner.
                        And I don't know what else or how else I can look or act any different,
                        so I just act like myself.
                        I used to get dressed to go shopping.
                        Now I never do that.
                        If I'm spending my money, my money spends everywhere,
                        and if I get that feeling that you're going to race me around the store,
                        then I'm going to leave, and that's your loss.
                        But I still get that, and so I worry.
                        So I also try to help people understand that this is not a socioeconomic,
                        once you've sort of "made it," you're out of the water.
                        No.
                        We're still, as someone with differences, visible differences, you're still at risk.

                        Yeah, that's a very good question.
                        So, I have two children.
                        I have a daughter who is 17 and a son who is 25.
                        And quite honestly, when that situation happened
                        in our Starbucks stores back in 2018,
                        my son was the same exact age as Donte and Rashon
                        and looks a lot like them, by the way,
                        and would have been sitting in the Starbucks
                        dressed the same way they were.
                        So that incident alone was deeply personal to me,
                        actually made me grab my chest, right?
                        Because I knew at any given moment
                        my husband or my son could get pulled over,
                        and I'd get that call in the middle of the night.
                        So it's deeply personal for me,
                        and what I try to do is I share stories,
                        and I talk very openly about my family and what we do on the weekends
                        and our holiday traditions and all of those things.
                        And I have no issue with someone leaning over to me,
                        maybe one of my white counterparts,
                        saying, "I don't understand that. What are they talking about?"
                        when they hear something that's a little bit different than their culture.

                        and start feeling out the environment
                        in your employee base, in your peers, in your leaders,
                        because the time is now, and so I don't give them an out.
                        I actually try and push them over the edge,
                        because sometimes they are just kind of stuck, like, "What do I do?"
                        And then the other thing that I personally have to do
                        is to make sure that they understand
                        that because I am at this level where I am,
                        I'm not excluded from these issues, right?
                        I know that when my husband jumps in his vehicle,
                        I worry every time if he's out in the evening
                        that he may not come back home the same way he left.
                        I feel that way for my son and for my husband.
                        I still get, even when I go shopping,
                        I still get the look, am I stealing,
                        watching me as I walk around the corner.
                        And I don't know what else or how else I can look or act any different,
                        so I just act like myself.
                        I used to get dressed to go shopping.
                        Now I never do that.
                        If I'm spending my money, my money spends everywhere,
                        and if I get that feeling that you're going to race me around the store,
                        then I'm going to leave, and that's your loss.
                        But I still get that, and so I worry.
                        So I also try to help people understand that this is not a socioeconomic,
                        once you've sort of "made it," you're out of the water.
                        No.
                        We're still, as someone with differences, visible differences, you're still at risk.

                        Yeah, that's a very good question.
                        So, I have two children.
                        I have a daughter who is 17 and a son who is 25.
                        And quite honestly, when that situation happened
                        in our Starbucks stores back in 2018,
                        my son was the same exact age as Donte and Rashon
                        and looks a lot like them, by the way,
                        and would have been sitting in the Starbucks
                        dressed the same way they were.
                        So that incident alone was deeply personal to me,
                        actually made me grab my chest, right?
                        Because I knew at any given moment
                        my husband or my son could get pulled over,
                        and I'd get that call in the middle of the night.
                        So it's deeply personal for me,
                        and what I try to do is I share stories,
                        and I talk very openly about my family and what we do on the weekends
                        and our holiday traditions and all of those things.
                        And I have no issue with someone leaning over to me,
                        maybe one of my white counterparts,
                        saying, "I don't understand that. What are they talking about?"
                        when they hear something that's a little bit different than their culture.
                        And I'm wide open to explain and have those conversations,
                        because I feel like I really want to be a conduit for that.
                        I always tell everyone, no question's too small or too big.
                        Even with everything that's going on right now
                        in our environment around social unrest,
                        I've gotten tons of calls from my white peers at different companies
                        saying, "Roz, what do you think? What are you hearing?
                        Help me out here."
                        I'll drop everything,
                        because if I can help, and I'll tell the story,
                        and I think most people know if they've known me over the years.
                        I'm pretty frank and outspoken.
                        And I'll also tell them when they've really messed up
                        and what they need to do about it.
                        And so I think I want more Black leaders
                        to feel just as confident in doing that.
                        I see no risk in it.
                        I do realize that it begins a new relationship with some people,
                        and some people can't take the tough conversations,
                        but it's time for tough conversations.

                        leaders lead in the moment,
                        and you never know when you're going to be called upon.
                        And if this isn't a calling,
                        I don't know what is.
                        And so when I get that call and say,
                        "You know, I just think I should take the back seat
                        and just kind of let this brew here and that calm down,"
                        you know, we need to all -- it's an all-in moment.
                        And leadership is not designated by your title.
                        It's designated about how great you can create followership.
                        And having thought leadership,
                        people underestimate the opportunity
                        to pick up the phone and call someone, and say, "How are you?
                        How is this affecting you? How can I help?"
                        That's pretty simple.
                        You might decide it's something I can't help with,
                        but you'd better darn sure pick up the phone

				<li>For the one billion women and men with disabilities, inclusion in the labour market, and in society in general, requires the breaking down of existing barriers. Companies have greater opportunities than ever before to bring in people with disabilities, as customers and clients, but also as employees and managers. By including people with disabilities, companies, individuals and society at large all win.

                    There are hundreds of specific choices involved in dealing with the many kinds of everyday ableism. But they all boil down to two basic options: confrontation or toleration. Traditionally, the standard tactic recommended for most disabled people was to “fit in” and “get along,” to shrug off “minor” personal ableism, like jokes and insensitive comments and actions –– maybe even laugh along. Don’t be offended. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Disabled people even bought into this and recommended this “easy-going” approach to each other. Some of us still do.
                    But it’s becoming more socially accepted and approved now to confront ableism, even when it’s just a “harmless” bit of “good-natured” fun. This is partly thanks to specific advancements in thinking about disability rights. It’s also a product of the way today’s broader culture is becoming more attuned to all forms of social injustice. Whatever else people may think about today’s intensified focus on language and behavior towards marginalized people, it has at least begun to allow them to stick up for themselves in ways that have a chance of being understood and accepted. As a result, disabled people finally have truly viable choices of how to respond to ableism. We don’t have to just take it and smile so people will feel comfortable with us.

                    How badly do we have to need that jar of peanut butter on a high shelf to bring us to ask a stranger or a store clerk to get it down for us? How far wrong do things have to go at work before a disabled employee really feels able to ask for accommodations? How far behind does a disabled college student have to get before they risk the bureaucracy and humiliation of asking for extended test time or other “special” arrangements?

Despite much greater awareness of ableism and disability rights, disabled people today often still feel passively encouraged to be “low maintenance.” This is especially true in high-stakes settings like education, health care, and employment. It’s an uncomfortable truth so ingrained in us that it rarely has to be stated: almost any disability can be accepted, as long as we don’t let it inconvenience anyone. Most disabled people understand this, even if we don’t fully accept it. So there are very obvious incentives to either do for ourselves, or else quietly leave things undone.

                    There are hundreds of specific choices involved in dealing with the many kinds of everyday ableism. But they all boil down to two basic options: confrontation or toleration. Traditionally, the standard tactic recommended for most disabled people was to “fit in” and “get along,” to shrug off “minor” personal ableism, like jokes and insensitive comments and actions –– maybe even laugh along. Don’t be offended. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Disabled people even bought into this and recommended this “easy-going” approach to each other. Some of us still do.
                    But it’s becoming more socially accepted and approved now to confront ableism, even when it’s just a “harmless” bit of “good-natured” fun. This is partly thanks to specific advancements in thinking about disability rights. It’s also a product of the way today’s broader culture is becoming more attuned to all forms of social injustice. Whatever else people may think about today’s intensified focus on language and behavior towards marginalized people, it has at least begun to allow them to stick up for themselves in ways that have a chance of being understood and accepted. As a result, disabled people finally have truly viable choices of how to respond to ableism. We don’t have to just take it and smile so people will feel comfortable with us.

                        Being bullied by someone can lower your self-esteem and affect how well you’re doing in school. While it’s usually best to talk to a parent or teacher about your bully, there are ways you can deal with bullies if you aren’t able to tell anyone immediately. Start by using your words and telling the bully that they need to stop in a calm voice. If your conversation escalates into a fight, you can either walk away or try to protect yourself. With a bit of confidence and perseverance, you bully may start leaving you alone.

<pattern>* FEEL * DIVERS AND INCLUS *</pattern>
<template>It's early days.
I'm hopeful.
I feel good about the conversations that are happening.
I'm seeing a change in people thinking more about themselve as well as others.
And so I feel like we can't let this moment leave us,
and what we're learning about it.
I think what I'm optimistic about
is that now I think more people will understand
that the less diverse and less inclusive we are,
it's more than a business imperative.
When we combine the pandemic
and we see the inequities of a pandemic
on a diverse community,
and we talk about how that happens,
how people are underrepresented in health care,
underrepresented in their housing,
they can see that this is a groundswell moment.
And the more we realize that and talk about that complexity,
then the solutions begin to happen.
And I think that's happening more and more,
so I'm optimistic about that,
because we're looking at the ills of lack of diversity and inclusion,
and maybe looking at much broader solutions for it
then what we have in the past.</template></category>

                    Culture is relative, which explains why individuals from different cultures may perceive American norms differently. For some, the American communication style may seem too direct, while others may find it not direct enough. As an international student, you will be exposed to many new customs, habits and ideas. Try to avoid labeling them as "good" or "bad" according to the culture you are from. Remember that there may be parts of a culture you dislike or disapprove of, but these are part of a broader social system, and therefore make more sense inside that system.
